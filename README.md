# SecurePass

## Introduction

A password manager is a tool that assists users in creating, managing, and safely storing passwords for a variety of online accounts. It stores the passwords in an encrypted vault that can only be accessed with a master password or biometric identification, eliminating the need to memorize several complicated passwords.

- SecurePass is designed to provide a secure, independent, and cross-platform solution, offering greater flexibility and security compared to tools like Google Password Manager. 
- SecurePass maintains detailed audit logs that track login attempts, data access, and modificationsâ€”providing users with full transparency over their account activity.
